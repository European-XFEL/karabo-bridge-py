How to use it at the EuXFEL
===========================

User tools running on European XFEL Online clusters can use the Karabo Bridge API to connect to Karabo pipelines and access data during an experiment.

Karabo bridge devices (from which karabo bridge clients can connect to and receive data) are running at all instruments.

Detailed setup for each instrument is available `here <https://in.xfel.eu/readthedocs/docs/data-analysis-user-documentation/en/latest/online.html#how-to-use-it-at-the-euxfel>`__.
